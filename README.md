# Grbl_Esp32_Web_Utility (GEWU)

The GEWU is a easy to use graphical user interface for Grbl_Esp32 that works entirely on your web browser.

This is perfect for the intial setup once your firmware has been installed. Once connected to the network, additional settings may be changed through the WebUI.

Current supported settings:

 * Wi-Fi / Access Point Mode
 * SSID & Password
 * Static or DHCP
 * IP Address
 * Access Point Channel
 * Gateway & Netmask
